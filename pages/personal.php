					<h3> Bio </h3>
					<p> I am currently finishing up my degree of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I currently live in <strong>Pittsburgh</strong>, PA but grew up in <strong>Scranton</strong>, PA. I chose to study computer science because I love the challenge of solving problems that are presented uniquely to this field. I also love how the widespread adoption of computers in almost every field allows people from this field to have a massively broad application field. </p>

					<h3> Disc Golf </h3>
					<p> When I am not working on developing applications you can usually find me on a <a href="http://vimeo.com/50806380" target="_blank">disc golf</a> course! I love being outdoors and competing. Disc Golf combines these two passions and is the reason I play year round in the heat, cold, rain or snow. Tournaments are played year round from singles events, doubles events to weekly leagues. If you haven’t played before I highly recommend it!  </p>

					<h3> Photography </h3>
					<p>A new passion of mine is photography. I began my amateur photography obsession last year when I purchased my first dSLR camera. I love capturing moments that last forever and finding the beauty in everyday things. There is always something new to learn and try out in photography. Whether it’s a new technique or a new piece of equipment it never get boring. All of the images throughout my website were either taken by me or edited by me.  </p>

					<h3> Hiking </h3>
					<p> Hiking is another passion of mine which I would say I have had for the longest. It is the reason I started playing disc golf and a huge driving factor for being a photographer. I enjoy the challenge of a difficult hike and the picturesque views at the end of hikes.  </p>
